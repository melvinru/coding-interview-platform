Question 1: Initial Implementation
Prompt:
"Build a real-time collaborative coding interview platform with a Monorepo structure.
Frontend: React + Vite.
Backend: Express + Socket.io.
Features:
1. Create a link and share it with candidates.
2. Allow everyone who connects to edit code in the code panel (Monaco Editor).
3. Show real-time updates to all connected users.
4. Support syntax highlighting for multiple languages.
5. Execute code safely in the browser (use Piston API initially, later switch to WASM for Python).
Please provide the project structure and initial code for client and server."

Question 2: Integration Tests
Command: `npm test` (in server directory)

Question 3: Running Both Client and Server
Command: `"dev": "concurrently \"npm run dev --prefix server\" \"npm run dev --prefix client\""`

Question 4: Syntax Highlighting
Library: `@monaco-editor/react`

Question 5: Code Execution
Library: `pyodide` (via CDN: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/v0.23.4/full/pyodide.js)
